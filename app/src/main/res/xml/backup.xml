    We specify here that we want to backup *only* the default shared preferences file. This is used
    to store user settings such as "notifications enabled".
    Using an <include ... /> here means that everything else is automatically excluded. This is
    desirable - we're automatically excluding things such as our Realm database, the "timestore" we
    use to hold server delta timestamps, and the Realm log files. We don't want to back up any of
    these.
